# Distributed Cache System
## Overview
This project implements a distributed cache system from the ground up, built entirely in Go. The system is designed to provide a fast, scalable, and reliable caching solution across multiple nodes in a distributed network. It leverages key-value storage and ensures data consistency and availability through efficient network communication and caching strategies.

## Key Features
- Distributed Architecture: The cache is distributed across multiple nodes, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. This design allows the system to scale horizontally, handling increased loads without a significant drop in performance.
- Key-Value Storage: The core of the cache is a key-value store, allowing quick data retrieval and storage. The system efficiently manages the data lifecycle, including cache eviction policies and memory management.
- Efficient Caching Strategies: Implements advanced caching strategies to maximize hit rates and minimize latency. The system dynamically adjusts to changing workloads, optimizing performance in real-time.
- Go Implementation: Developed entirely in Go, the system takes full advantage of Go's concurrency model, allowing it to handle multiple requests simultaneously with minimal overhead.
## What I Learned
Working on this distributed cache system provided me with invaluable experience in several critical areas:

- Distributed Systems: I deepened my understanding of distributed systems, particularly in managing state across multiple nodes, ensuring consistency, and handling network partitioning. This project highlighted the complexities of distributed architectures and the importance of designing resilient, scalable systems.

- Caching Mechanisms: I explored various caching mechanisms and strategies, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) and Time-to-Live (TTL), and learned how to implement these efficiently in a distributed environment. This knowledge is essential for optimizing performance in applications that require fast data access.

- Concurrency in Go: Building the cache in Go allowed me to leverage its powerful concurrency features, such as goroutines and channels. I learned how to effectively manage concurrent operations and synchronize data access across multiple threads, ensuring thread safety and data integrity.

- Network Communication: Implementing the communication layer for the distributed cache required a solid understanding of network protocols and socket programming. I gained experience in handling low-level networking tasks, including connection management, message serialization, and data transmission.

## Conclusion
Working on this project allowed me to dive deep into the intricacies of distributed systems, especially around the challenges of caching, maintaining data consistency, and optimizing performance. The experience reinforced my interest in building robust, scalable backend solutions and tackling complex engineering problems. As I continue to explore these areas, I look forward to applying what I've learned to future projects and evolving my understanding of distributed architectures and system design.

## Future Improvements
During this project, I was introduced to the Raft consensus algorithm, which is crucial for achieving consensus in distributed systems. Initially, I was implementing a follower-leader pattern while ignorant to the Raft Consensus Algorithm. After I had discovered it, I decided that I wanted to continue with my original implementation and save it for another project. 

I am currently implementing Raft from scratch as my next deep dive into distributed system design. You can follow my progress on this [Raft consensus project](https://github.com/Tuvshno/Raft-Go).
